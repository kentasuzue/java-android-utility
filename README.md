# java-android-utility
The utility generates field goal percentage statistics for a basketball roster. It is designed for use while watching a game live or on video. At the level of middle school girls basketball, field goal percentage is enough to indicate who should be shooting more (and who should not).

The 3 tabs are "ADD ROSTER," "ADD SHOTS," and "VIEW STATS." When a player's # and name are entered into the roster in the "ADD ROSTER" tab, the player's # and name are copied into the remaining tabs. If the player's name is too long, then in the remaining tabs the player's name is shortened with ellipsis. In the "ADD SHOTS" tab, shots made and shots missed are updated with plus and minus buttons, while watching a game live or on video. Both shots made and shots missed have a floor of 0, such that when shots made equals 0 the minus button for shots made does nothing, and when shots missed equals 0 the minus button for shots missed does nothing. The "VIEW STATS" tab shows field goal percentage of 100* (shots made) / (shots made + shots missed), or shows NA if no shot attempts have been made.
